# Proofs Portfolio

This repository contains a small portfolio of selected mathematical proofs written during my undergraduate coursework in Proofs and Fundamentals.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my approach to rigorous reasoning, use of definitions, and clarity of exposition.

The compiled PDF is intended for reading; LaTeX sources are not included.
